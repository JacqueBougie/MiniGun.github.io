			My name is Jacque Bougie. I am a junior in high school, and I am currently taking dual credit courses through <a href="https://www.bju.edu" target="_blank">Bob Jones University</a>.<br>
			I am hoping to go to BJU in the fall of 2019 to major in computer science. I have lived at <a href="http://www.thewildsofnewengland.org/" target="_blank">The Wilds of New England</a> since 2008, and I will be<br>
			working on the maintenance/landscape crew this summer. I enjoy working with computers, programming, and 3D design. I started dabbling in programming when I was 12 when I got my first laptop. I started getting into 3D design too,<br>
			but my little laptop could not handle it. I built my own desktop computer when I was 14 so that I could do 3D 
			designing much easier.</p>
