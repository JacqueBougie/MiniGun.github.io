			<p1>My name is Jacque Bougie. I am a junior in high school, and I am currently taking dual credit</p1>
			<p1>courses through <a href="https://www.bju.edu/" target="_blank">Bob Jones University</a>. I am hoping to go to BJU in the fall of 2019 to major in computer science.</p1>
			<p1>I have lived at <a href="http://thewildsofnewengland.org" target="_blank">The Wilds of New England</a> since 2008, and I will be working on the maintenance/landscape crew</p1>
			<p1>this summer. I enjoy working with computers, programming, and 3D design. I started dabbling in programming</p1>
			<p1>when I was 12, and I got my first laptop. I started getting into 3D design too, but my little laptop could</p1>
			<p1>not handle it. I built my own desktop computer when I was 14; making 3D designing much easier.</p1>
